# Prosthetic Simulation Project
A program that simulates the trajectory of the finger and thumb of an arm prosthetic
The program consists of four sub programs:
> prints out the relevant calculations (input speed and gear ratio) to the provided file
> the simulation of the trajectory of the finger and thumb of an arm prosthetic using vPython
> a quiz regarding computer and biomedical engineering questions
> the rotation of a gear attached via Raspberry Pi
