# Python Program: Arm Prosthetic Simulation, Quiz, and Gear Rotation

This Python program includes four sub-programs that perform different functions related to computer and biomedical engineering. Each sub-program is briefly described below.

## Sub-Program 1: Calculation Printer

This sub-program allows users to input speed and gear ratio values and prints out the relevant calculations to a specified file. It provides a convenient way to perform calculations and save the results for future reference or analysis.

## Sub-Program 2: Arm Prosthetic Simulation

Using the vPython library, this sub-program simulates the trajectory of the finger and thumb of an arm prosthetic. It utilizes realistic physics and visualization techniques to provide a realistic representation of the arm movement. Users can interact with the simulation and observe the prosthetic arm's behavior in different scenarios.

## Sub-Program 3: Engineering Quiz

This sub-program presents users with a quiz comprising computer and biomedical engineering questions. It tests the user's knowledge in various areas of these fields, including programming, hardware, algorithms, and medical devices. Users can answer the quiz questions and receive immediate feedback on their performance.

## Sub-Program 4: Gear Rotation with Raspberry Pi

In this sub-program, a gear attached to a Raspberry Pi is rotated using appropriate controls. The program interfaces with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to control the rotation of the gear. It provides an example of how to integrate hardware components with Python programming for physical computing applications.
